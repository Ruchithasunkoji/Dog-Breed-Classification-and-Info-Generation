# Dog-Breed-Classification-and-Info-Generation
The Dog Breed Classification and Info Generation project aims to develop an AI-powered system that identifies dog breeds from images and generates relevant breed-specific information. Using machine learning, the model will classify various dog breeds and provide insights such as breed characteristics, temperament, and care instructions.
